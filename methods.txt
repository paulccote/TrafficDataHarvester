Basic Measurements
------------------
> Detecting cars
	--> handled by our cNN model(s) 
	--> will have to test a model on one camera angle and then test that same model on a different angle
		-> if it sucks(bad accuracy) then we have to have different model for each angle
	--> Have a predefined threshold for when model won't detect a car? When it's way far away. 
	
> Traffic Density 
	--> Count the number of boxes on screen (find software to do this)
	--> will be a %, based on the maximum number of boxes/cars that can be on the screen at one time, based on angle 
	--> Have to consider situations where there are many cars right next to each other in high traffic.
		-> can our model pick out separate cars if it looks like they're stacked on top each other?
	--> Might be better to count boxes than to measure distances between cars. 
		-> However, lots of overlap of cars makes either method more difficult
> Time of day 
	--> Determine whether this is the morning commute, lunch break, rush hour, etc. 
	--> picture file should have timestamp of when the footage was taken. 


Advanced(opt.) Measurements
